# lettuce-database

Epoch-2 SQLite schema, migrations, maintenance, and repository adapters.

## Boundary

The only crate allowed to depend on SQLite libraries.

The public surface is intentionally small. Business invariants belong in domain models and use cases; infrastructure is accessed only through narrow ports owned by the calling crate.

## Foundation schema

Migration 1 creates only migration bookkeeping plus four usable roots:
global settings, provider accounts, model profiles, and content-addressed media
blobs. Later feature tables arrive with their owning vertical slices.

`Database` owns a serialized `rusqlite` connection, enables foreign keys and a
bounded busy timeout, and uses WAL for persistent files. Repository traits stay
in their domain crates; this crate contains their SQLite implementations. The
application is responsible for running these synchronous operations on its
database worker rather than a UI or async-runtime thread.

Secrets are never stored here. Provider rows contain opaque `SecretRef` values
only. Logical media assets are also intentionally deferred: this foundation
deduplicates immutable blobs, while later domain associations own asset
provenance and retention.
