# lettuce-app

The sole composition root, application workflows, desktop IPC boundary, and
optional local OpenAI-compatible host API.

## Boundary

May wire all crates; no crate may depend on it. Host API handlers reuse the
model and inference services without constructing product conversations.

The public surface is intentionally small. Business invariants belong in domain models and use cases; infrastructure is accessed only through narrow ports owned by the calling crate.

## Status

Foundation scaffolding is active. Implement behavior with tests before exposing new public APIs, and keep compatibility code at explicit application or migration boundaries.

## Bundled prompts

The app owns the closed, versioned built-in prompt catalog in
`resources/built-in-prompts/v1.json`. It is embedded with `include_str!`, so
bootstrap and reset work from the application binary on desktop and Android
without depending on installation paths or writable files.

`BuiltInPromptService` reconciles unedited seeds during startup and supports
explicit reset of one or every protected prompt. Consumers keep the returned
`BuiltInPromptIds` instead of hard-coding database UUIDs. The stable legacy
catalog keys and entry keys are compatibility identities; user-facing names
and content remain editable, while purpose and lifecycle protection do not.

`AppBackend::open` is the supported production database-open path. It opens the
caller-provided SQLite path, applies database migrations, bootstraps the
catalog, and returns the database together with the complete typed prompt ID
set. This prevents a host from accidentally serving an initialized database
without the required app prompts. `AppBackend::open_in_memory` provides the
same invariant for tests.

The adjacent `v1.snap` pins a canonical digest for every individual entry,
including its stable key, role, content, scheduling, conditions, payload, and
system-prompt flag. A change to one legacy field therefore identifies the
specific prompt entry instead of appearing only as a catalog-wide checksum.
